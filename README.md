# Homework3 Open-Source Energy System Modeling,

In this exercise , we add a new technology “gas power plant” to westeros-baseline  
(cost parameters and lifetimes assumed realistic for this power plant type)

In westeros-emission-bounded and westeros-emission-taxes attempt to find out :
Is there a “sweet spot” of prices on carbon such that coal, wind and gas are used
at the same time?
